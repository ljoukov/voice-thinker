# Scale with Voice

What if setting up law firm front-office required **nothing**?

Like literally nothing.

How so?

Well, you give the AI agent your website URL, it scans it and figures out setup for the voice agent which'd answer your phone calls.

This project demonstrates it working for PI (personal injury) law firms.

## The Market: The Personal-Injury Law Firm Landscape

- **A Large Market:** There are over 48,000 personal-injury law firms in the United States.
- **High Lead Volume:** These firms handle a surprisingly high number of inquiries.
  - Median leads per firm: **36,255**
  - Consultations scheduled from leads: **2,559** (a low 7% conversion rate)
- **Slow Conversion:** The median time to convert a lead into a signed client is **3 days**.
- **Aggressive Marketing:** Even small firms with 3-4 lawyers can receive hundreds of inquiries monthly by investing in SEO and PPC. One Texas firm reported 800-1,000 quality leads per month after an aggressive ad campaign.

### The Takeaway

Most PI firms are small, but the contingency-fee model incentivizes them to maintain large intake funnels and advertise aggressively to find viable cases. This creates a significant operational burden in managing and qualifying leads.

## The Solution: Fully Automated AI Agent Setup

We propose a fully automated system where an AI agent can be set up simply by providing the firm's website URL. The system consists of multiple specialized agents:

1.  **Setup Agent:** Browses the firm's website to create prompts for the other agents.
2.  **Phone Answering Agent (Front Office):**
    - Handles greetings and provides instructions (e.g., checklists).
    - Accesses the firm's CRM (via MCP).
3.  **Leads Processing Agent (CRM Agent):**
    - Tracks the status of inquiries.
    - Notifies both the lawyer and the client of updates.
4.  **Customer Follow-up Agent:**
    - Calls the client for follow-ups.
    - Sends reminders and updates via text, email, or post.

## Why is this better than a manual process?

- **Client Comfort:** Customers can take their time and may feel more comfortable sharing sensitive information with an AI agent compared to a human representative.
- **Efficiency:** The AI agent prepares a concise brief for the lawyer, saving time and effort.
- **Availability:** The AI agent is available 24/7 to handle inquiries.
